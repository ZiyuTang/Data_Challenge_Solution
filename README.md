## <a name="ab_test"></a>Q2 Spanish Translation A/B Test
Project Goal:
- Confirm that the test is actually negative. That is, it appears that the old version of the site with just one translation across Spain and LatAm performs better
- Explain why that might be happening. Are the localized translations really worse?
- If you identified what was wrong, design an algorithm that would return FALSE if the same problem is happening in the future and TRUE if everything is good and the results can be trusted.
